# TASK IT

Task what? Task It.

I wanted to make a task tracking app that kept data in the browser's cache, which I would export daily to a spreadsheet. Unfortunately, I was sidetracked while listening to YouTube and went down the road of creating a game tracking interface for when I play MTG: The Gathering. I'm sure I'll get to the task tracking part eventually.
