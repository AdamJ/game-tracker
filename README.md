# Game Tracker

## What is this?

A "tracker" of sorts wherein users can keep track of their life totals, match history, and tournament standings. Primarily designed for games of Magic: The Gathering, there are three separate styles of trackers - Tournament, EDH/Commander, and Standard (1v1).

### History

Originally, I wanted to make a task tracking app that kept data in the browser's cache, which I would export daily to a spreadsheet. Ultimately, I was sidetracked while listening to YouTube and went down the road of creating a game tracking interface for when I play MTG: The Gathering. I'm sure I'll get back to the task tracking part eventually.
